# Mapzen iOS SDK

The Mapzen iOS SDK is a thin wrapper that packages up everything you need to use Mapzen services in your iOS applications. It also simplifies setup, installation, API key management and generally makes your life better.

## Components

Our SDK includes map rendering, search/geocoding, routing client, and location tracking. It's built using the following standalone libraries and services from Mapzen:

* **[Tangram ES](https://github.com/tangrams/tangram-es)** 2D and 3D map renderer using OpenGL ES
* **[Pelias iOS SDK](https://github.com/pelias/pelias-ios-sdk)** Mapzen Search client for iOS
* **[On the Road iOS](https://github.com/mapzen/on-the-road_ios)** Mapzen Routing client and routing utilities
