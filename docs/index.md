# Mapzen iOS SDK

## Coming soon

We are hard at work on our iOS SDK to bring you open source maps, geographic search, and turn-by-turn directions to your iOS apps. It will also simplify setup, installation, API key management and generally make your life better.

## Components

Our iOS SDK is being built using the following standalone libraries and services from Mapzen:

* **[Tangram ES](https://github.com/tangrams/tangram-es)** 2D and 3D map renderer using OpenGL ES
* **[Pelias iOS SDK](https://github.com/pelias/pelias-ios-sdk)** Mapzen Search client for iOS
* **[On the Road iOS](https://github.com/mapzen/on-the-road_ios)** Mapzen Turn-by-Turn client and routing utilities

## Can't wait?

*Neither can we.*

While we are working on assembling all the pieces you can [follow our progress on GitHub](https://github.com/mapzen/ios).
